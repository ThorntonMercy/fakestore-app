Fake Store App

Our task was to create a fake store using the FakeStoreAPI. 

Our site requirements:
1. A homepage with a welcome message and a button leading to our product listings.
2. A product listing page that had the ability to click on individual products.
3. A product addition page that allowed users to add a new product to the API.
4. Utilize FakeStoreAPI including post, put, delete requests.
5. Utilize React Bootstrap for navbar, styling, and mobile responsiveness.
6. Handle API errors and loading states.
7. Use ReactRouter for site navigation.
8. Confirmation messages and/or modals for product creation, product updating, and product deleting.


Our products had to display:
1. Product name
2. Product price
3. Product description
4. Product image
5. Buttons to add to cart (without actual functionality), edit listing, and delete listing. 


I went with a really basic black/white/grey type of color scheme for this site, as I can't say I've ever really seen a successful webstore that had bright colors. 

The homepage has a green (success) color button to take users to the product listing page. The product listing page has aqua blue(info) colored buttons. The item page has three buttons with different colors to make them visually distinct, so that if it were a functioning shop, users would be able to easily tell the buttons apart. 

Based off of feedback given in an earlier project, I ensured that the navbar had adequate left padding so it isn't flush against the browser. I also added some minor custom CSS to handle the image sizes, as I was annoyed by the random sizing of the API images. 

The forms all have validation so that the different product inputs cannot be left blank, either while editing a product or adding a new one.
